Examining the scatter plot reveals an inverse relationship between mouse weight and drug effectiveness, particularly for Capomulin. The linear regression analysis yields a robust correlation with an r-value of 0.95, emphasizing the weight-dependent impact on drug efficacy.

The box plots of final tumor volumes suggest that Capomulin demonstrates comparable effectiveness to Ramicane, outperforming Infubinol and Ceftamin significantly.

The consistency of the study results is notable, with only one outlier identified in the dataset for the top drugs, and none for Capomulin. This consistency enhances the reliability of the study findings.
